            programs, and youth without a permanent place to stay. New clients always are
          accepted on a walk-in basis every Monday, Friday, and Sunday at the
         hours listed below, and they are located in Metro Baptist Church at 410

           youth as they are without judgment and with no barriers to entry.
           Identification and paperwork are not required for registration,
           and a referral letter is not necessary. They also will provide
