      <h2>SNAP</h2>
      <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/state-directory"
      target=blank><button id="dropbtn">Find Places to Apply</button></a>
      <p>Your first and most important step should be to apply for SNAP
        (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), also known as “food stamps”).
         If you are living in the United States, or through any social programs your
          country has set up if you’re living outside the United States. With EBT,
          most individuals can qualify for $200 worth of funds that can be used to
          purchase food each month. However, the amount of assistance available for
          each family depends on many different factors. </p>

      <h2>Shelters</h2>
      <a href="https://www.homelessshelterdirectory.org/"

      <p>Most shelters that offer beds also offer food services, at least in the
        United States, the UK, Australia, and the majority of developed countries.
        Some may offer some packaged foods or bags of food, but the vast majority
        of them offer home-cooked style meals and the food is normally donated to
        them by charities, food drives, and nearby grocery stores or other
        companies. </p>

        target=blank><button id="dropbtn">Find Food Pantries Nearby</button></a>
        <p>When it comes to packaged meals and groceries, food pantries seem to be
           the best place to go for this. Most food pantries will hand out a large
           grocery bag full of ready to eat food, food that involves cooking, or a
           combination of both. However, they will often limit how many times you
           can visit them within a certain time period. </p>

          <p>Most churches (the decent ones anyways), will offer some form of
            charity to the homeless in the form of food at certain times or on
            certain days. They will either offer warm meals that are served on
            the premises, or they will offer some form of bagged meals, which
            is usually a brown paper bag filled with essentials such as a
            sandwich, a banana, and a juice box. For instance, The St.
            Vincent De Paul Society was established in the U.S. in 1845 and
            is operated by the Catholic Church. It has the mission is to
            provide for all those in need. The organization provides church
            food pantries in a variety of communities, as well as thrift
            stores that provide clothing and a wide range of other services. </p>
